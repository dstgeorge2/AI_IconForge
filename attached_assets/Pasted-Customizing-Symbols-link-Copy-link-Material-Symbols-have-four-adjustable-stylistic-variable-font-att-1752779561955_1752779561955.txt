Customizing Symbols

Material Symbols have four adjustable stylistic variable font attributes called axes. An axis is a typographic term referring to the attribute of a symbol that can be altered to create visual variations. 

Each style symbol contains four axes: weight, fill, grade, and optical size.

Weight
Weight defines the symbol’s stroke weight, with a range of weights between thin (100) and bold (700). Weight can also affect the overall size of the symbol.

Fill
Fill gives you the ability to transition from a more outlined style to a reversed or more filled style. 

A fill attribute can be used to convey a state of transition, such as unfilled and filled states. Values range from 0 to 1, with 1 being completely filled. Along with weight, fill is a primary attribute that impacts the overall look of a symbol.

Grade
Weight and grade affect a symbol’s thickness. Adjustments to grade are more granular than adjustments to weight and have a smaller impact on the size of the symbol.

Grade is also available in some text fonts. Grade levels between text and symbols can be matched for a harmonious visual effect. For example, if the text font has a -25 grade value, the symbols can match it with a suitable value of -25.

Grade can also compensate for visual bleed, which is when images can look bigger or smaller depending on the color contrast. To match the apparent icon size, the default grade for a dark icon on a light background is 0, and -25 for a light icon on a dark background.

To make strokes heavier and more emphasized, use positive value grade, such as when representing an active icon state.

Optical sizes
Optical sizes range from 20dp to 48dp.

For the image to look the same at different sizes, the stroke weight (thickness) changes as the icon size scales. Optical size offers a way to automatically adjust the stroke weight when you increase or decrease the symbol size.

Traditionally, icons are resized from a 24dp source vector, resulting in a large scaled icon that’s too heavy compared to the original. With the optical size axis, you can maintain the stroke weight (thickness) as the icon size grows.
