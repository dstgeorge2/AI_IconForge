Absolutely — here’s a formalized Icon Design Rule Set for PTC Windchill, tuned to support enterprise complexity, system-of-systems workflows, and the unique needs of Windchill users in engineering, manufacturing, and configuration-heavy environments.

🔧 PTC Windchill Icon Design Rule Set

Version: 2025.1
Audience: Designers, iconographers, engineers, and product owners
Goal: Establish a durable, semantic, and accessible icon system that improves UX clarity, system performance, and long-term design consistency across Windchill.

⸻

🧭 1. Purpose & Context

Icons in Windchill serve:
	•	As functional symbols in dense object-based UIs (e.g., CAD trees, BOMs, change controls)
	•	To reinforce complex workflows involving products, configurations, documents, and manufacturing objects
	•	To support high-stakes industrial decisions — where visual clarity can reduce errors

Icons must not just look good — they must work under:
	•	Cognitive load
	•	Role-based dashboards
	•	Accessibility constraints
	•	Varying screen scales (16–48dp)

⸻

🎯 2. Icon Function & Semantic Scope

Icon Type	Role
Object icons	Represent nouns in Windchill (e.g., workspace, CAD part, document)
Action icons	Represent verbs (e.g., add, delete, edit, release)
Status icons	Represent metadata (e.g., locked, under review, recently changed)
Navigation icons	Represent location/context (e.g., home, folder, dashboard)
Composite icons	Combine noun + verb (e.g., add to workspace) — max 2 metaphors

Icons must always be:
	•	Describable in plain language (e.g., “this shows a new document being created”)
	•	Role-aware (e.g., a designer sees different icons than a manufacturing planner)

⸻

📐 3. Geometry & Layout Rules

Attribute	Specification
Canvas size	24dp × 24dp
Live area	20dp × 20dp (centered)
Padding	2dp minimum on all sides
Stroke weight	2dp (optically adjusted if needed)
Stroke style	Solid black, square or clipped terminals
Corner radius	2dp for outer corners, square for interior joints
Line alignment	All strokes must be pixel-snapped, no subpixel rendering
Angle system	45°, 90°, or multiples of 15° only


⸻

🧩 4. Shape & Form Principles

Rule	Description
Primary metaphor only	Each icon must be built around one recognizable metaphor
Max 2 support shapes	Only include extra forms if they add clear meaning (e.g., tab on folder)
No abstraction for abstraction’s sake	Forms must reflect real system concepts (e.g., not “magic spark” for automation)
Use dynamic symmetry	Optical balance is preferred over strict geometric centering
No 3D, isometric, or shading	Icons must remain flat and orthographic
No decorative borders or gradients	Unless functionally required (e.g., boundary distinction for file/folder)


⸻

✨ 5. Decorative Elements

Element	Rules
Sparkles	Use 4-point stars; max 1–2 per icon; rotate 15–30°; size 1.5–3dp
Dots	For activity/state hinting; max 3; 1–1.5dp each; optically spaced
Pluses/Minuses	Use square-ended lines; must not obscure core shape
No emojis, glyphs, or cartoon effects	Maintain enterprise tone and system fit


⸻

📚 6. Visual Language Fit

System	Harmony Rules
Material 3	Follow CDS or M3 stroke structure and grid discipline
IBM Carbon	Respect geometric purity and functional labeling clarity
Windchill legacy icons	New icons may replace or visually echo old ones but must be scalable and accessible
Industrial UI needs	Prioritize clarity at small sizes (16dp), strong contrast, and metaphor recognition under load


⸻

♿ 7. Accessibility & Clarity
	•	Contrast Ratio: Minimum 4.5:1 (stroke against background)
	•	No color-only meaning — color can support state but never carry primary meaning
	•	Icon must retain identity at 16dp
	•	Touch target spacing: If used interactively, must be spaced for finger tap (min 48dp bounding box)

⸻

🛠️ 8. Technical Implementation

Output Format	Requirements
SVG	Clean stroke-based path; no embedded bitmap fills
Figma Component	Centered 24x24 frame with nested auto-layout where needed
Naming	snake_case, function-first (add_workspace, delete_object)
Metadata Tags	Tool type, user role, object type, system domain (e.g., “BOM”, “CAD”, “workflow”)
Versioning	Each icon must have a tracked design spec and rendering version
Optical Adjustments	Must be documented if lines or alignment deviate from grid for balance


⸻

📈 9. Strategic Design Considerations
	•	Icons are not decorative — they are semantic UI infrastructure
	•	Windchill’s complexity requires icons to:
	•	Disambiguate dense UIs
	•	Reduce cognitive load across roles
	•	Scale across object trees, tables, modals, toolbars
	•	Each new icon must be:
	•	Justifiable (why it exists)
	•	Distinguishable (how it differs from neighbors)
	•	Composable (how it supports workflows)

⸻

✅ 10. Summary: Icons Should…

Do This	Avoid This
Use clear stroke metaphors	Abstract blobs or gradient shapes
Maintain 2dp visual rhythm	Jagged pixel outlines or 3D bevels
Express function, not style	Decorative embellishments
Work across enterprise roles	Role-agnostic generic glyphs
Scale down to 16dp cleanly	Over-detailed microglyphs
Fit Windchill’s industrial tone	Playful, emoji-style graphics
