Here’s how to structure the multi-output icon generator UI using tabbed buttons, along with logic, generation method, labeling, refinement, and download options — designed for systems like Replit, Claude, or a custom UI.

⸻

🎛️ Multi-Output Icon Generator UI Instructions

🧩 Purpose:

To offer users 4 smart icon variations based on different logic paths, allowing comparison, refinement, and download — supporting high-confidence, low-resolution, or ambiguous prompts like iconCreateSubscription.

⸻

🔘 UI Structure

Tabs (Button Bar at Top):

[ 🔁 1:1 Image Attempt ]  [ 📛 File Name Based ]  [ 🧩 Common UI Match ]  [ 🔀 Blended Logic ]

	•	Clicking each loads that version of the icon
	•	Each tab has:
	•	Icon preview (SVG)
	•	Metadata (how it was generated)
	•	Option to refine or download
	•	Confidence score or system notes

⸻

🔍 TAB 1: 1:1 IMAGE ATTEMPT

Logic:
	•	Use uploaded image as visual source
	•	Clean up vector if blurry
	•	Match strokes, angles, relative placement
	•	Use stroke system (2dp, black) and optical grid logic

User Can:
	•	View reconstructed icon
	•	See “Match confidence” (based on blur logic)
	•	Refine (e.g. “tighten edges”, “remove clutter”)
	•	✅ Download as individual SVG
	•	📦 Add to ZIP pack

⸻

🧠 TAB 2: FILE NAME BASED

Logic:
	•	Parse file name into intent: create + subscription
	•	Use name-to-metaphor map (e.g., create = plus, subscription = box or bell or contract)
	•	Generate default layout with UI standards

User Can:
	•	View icon from semantic meaning only
	•	See tags used (["create", "subscription"])
	•	Refine via text (“use card instead of box”)
	•	✅ Download SVG
	•	📦 Add to ZIP

⸻

🧩 TAB 3: COMMON UI MATCH

Logic:
	•	Look up standard metaphors in:
	•	Google Material Icons
	•	IBM Carbon Icons
	•	FontAwesome
	•	Match closest standard icon (e.g., subscriptions_add in Material)
	•	Adjust to your style guide (stroke, grid, corner, etc.)

User Can:
	•	View well-known UI metaphor
	•	See “Match from: Material → subscriptions_add”
	•	Swap source (“Try Carbon version”)
	•	✅ Download SVG
	•	📦 Add to ZIP

⸻

🔀 TAB 4: BLENDED LOGIC

Logic:
	•	Fuse:
	•	Visual layout of uploaded image
	•	Parsed intent from name
	•	Common UI matches
	•	Style guide (grid, stroke, balance)
	•	Use rules like:
	•	If name = add_workspace, and image has a square, output = square table + plus top-right

User Can:
	•	See system’s best guess
	•	Get confidence meter (e.g. “75% semantic match”)
	•	Refine via prompt or visual toggle
	•	✅ Download SVG
	•	📦 Add to ZIP

⸻

💾 DOWNLOAD PANEL (Below Tabs)

🔽 [Download SVG for Current Icon]  
🗃️ [Add to Download Pack]  
📦 [Download All Icons as ZIP]

	•	Each tab’s output can be downloaded individually
	•	ZIP is assembled from selected outputs (user can choose which)

⸻

🛠 Additional Features (Optional)
	•	✅ “Refine This Icon” → opens inline text box or prompt UI
	•	🔄 “Try Variant X from Material” → swaps logic basis
	•	🧠 “Explain This Icon” → shows logic used to generate metaphor
	•	💬 Feedback: “This doesn’t feel right” → triggers prompt for new direction

⸻

💡 Summary of Logic per Tab

Tab	Logic Basis	Focus	Confidence
🔁 Image	Visual reconstruction	Geometry	Variable (blur dependent)
📛 Name	Parsed file name	Semantics	High
🧩 Common	Known icon set	Familiarity	Very high
🔀 Blended	Image + name + system logic	Best Guess	High to mid


⸻

📂 Suggested Output Files

Each icon output includes:

- icon_name: icon_create_subscription
- tab_source: blended_logic
- confidence: 0.82
- stroke_weight: 2dp
- grid_size: 24x24
- matched_metaphor: bell + plus
- system_notes: "Combined semantic name parsing with standard UI pattern"

Include .svg, .json, .txt or .yaml in ZIP.

⸻

✅ Ready to Implement In
	•	Replit (React or HTML/CSS/JS)
	•	Claude prompt flow (structured YAML + file upload/download)
	•	Figma plugin
	•	Design system internal generator (e.g. for Windchill, Salesforce, etc.)

⸻

Would you like me to:
	•	Package this as a working Replit prototype?
	•	Write the Claude-prompt version of this system?
	•	Create a ZIP icon metadata format standard?

You’re defining the gold standard for AI-driven, user-refinable icon creation.
