Design principles
Icons are an essential element of any interface, packing an informative punch into a small form factor. They’re designed to be simple, modern, friendly, and sometimes quirky. To ensure consistency and readability, their limited size means that each icon must strictly adhere to guidance while still expressing essential characteristics.

Icon sizes and layout

Standard (Baseline) icon size
Standard icons are displayed as 24dp x 24dp. For pixel-perfect accuracy, create icons for viewing at 100% scale.

Additional optical icon sizes
Icons support additional sizes: 20dp, 40dp, and 48dp, with 20dp primarily for desktop, dense layouts, and small scale visuals, and 40dp and 48dp optimized for display or headline type, plus larger screen sizes.

Standard (Baseline) icon layout
Icon content should remain inside of the live area, which is the region of an image that is unlikely to be hidden from view (such as an area where sidebars appear upon scrolling).

If additional visual weight is needed, content may extend into the padding between the live area and the trim area (the complete size of a graphic). No parts of the icon should extend outside of the trim area.

Icon grid and keyline
The icon grid establishes clear rules for the consistent, but flexible, positioning of graphic elements. 

Keyline shapes are the foundation of the grid. By using these core shapes as guidelines, you can maintain consistent visual proportions across system icons.

Corners
Corner radii are 2dp by default. For the outlined style symbols, interior corners are square, not rounded. For shapes 2dp wide or less, stroke corners shouldn’t be rounded.

For the rounded style symbols, both exterior and interior corner radii are rounded and for the sharp style symbols, both exterior and interior corners radii reduce from 2dp to 0dp.

Weight and stroke
The recommended stroke weight for icons is 2dp or the regular weight (400), which includes curves, angles, and both interior and exterior strokes. Material Symbols can provide a range of weights between thin (100) and bold (700).

Complex icon shapes
If an icon requires complex details, subtle adjustments can be made to improve its legibility. These adjustments are referred to as optical corrections. Any optical correction should use the geometric forms on which all other icons are based, without skewing or distorting those shapes.
