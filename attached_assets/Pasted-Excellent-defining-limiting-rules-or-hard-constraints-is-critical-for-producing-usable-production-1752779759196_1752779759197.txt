Excellent — defining limiting rules or hard constraints is critical for producing usable, production-grade icons. These rules prevent randomness, enforce design system compliance, and guide the logic engine to produce consistent, legible outputs.

Below is a categorized list of non-negotiable constraints (⚠️ hard rules) and strong design heuristics (✅ soft guardrails) your system should enforce across generation, recognition, and validation.

🔒 HARD RULES: Icon Generation Constraints (Non-negotiable)

Category	Rule
Color	❌ No color. All icons must be black or monochrome vector (pure black #000 or theme-injected fill only).
Geometry	❌ No abstract or random shapes. All geometry must represent a recognizable concept or metaphor.
Fill/Stroke	❌ No gradients, blurs, or shadows. Icons must be constructed with solid strokes and/or solid fills only.
Canvas	🔲 Icon must fit on a 24×24dp canvas. No elements can extend beyond the trim area.
Stroke Weight	⚖️ Fixed 2dp stroke for Carbon; Material uses style-locked weights (100–700). Must be consistent per icon.
Corner Radius	🔘 Rounded corners must follow system rules: 2dp max for Carbon; Material varies by style (rounded, sharp).
Perspective	⬜ Must be flat or front-facing. ❌ No isometric or skewed angles.
Interaction	❌ No animation, hover states, or interaction logic within the icon SVG itself.
File Type	💾 Must output clean, optimized SVG (no raster, no embedded fonts, no external styles).
Alignment	⬇️ Centered horizontally and vertically; geometry must align to pixel grid (whole integers).
Icon Type	🧩 Must be an icon, not illustration or pictogram — minimal, abstracted, functional form.
Ambiguity	❌ No multi-metaphor mashups unless explicitly requested. One icon = one idea.

✅ SOFT GUARDRAILS: Strong Recommendations

Category	Guideline
Meaningful Composition	Each icon must communicate a single, coherent action, object, or concept at a glance.
Recognizability	Icon should be immediately recognizable without relying on labels, except for abstract system states.
Label Compatibility	Icon should pair well with adjacent text labels without visual imbalance.
System Consistency	Use shared geometry patterns across icon sets (e.g., plus, arrow, folder should match others).
Live Area Use	Content should remain inside 20×20dp live area with 2dp padding (for 24dp grid).
Visual Weight	Balance all elements visually—avoid one-sided density or misaligned components.
Optical Corrections	Allow slight manual adjustments for visual balance (e.g., 1.5dp stroke if needed).
Icon Role	System must tag icons with type: action, object, status, navigation, or tool.
Locale Review	Consider global metaphors: 🧺 “basket” ≠ 🛒 “cart” ≠ 🎒 “bag” — localize appropriately.

🚫 Examples of Violations

Violation	Why it breaks the rules
Multicolor icon	❌ Breaks monochrome rule
3D or isometric printer	❌ Breaks flat perspective rule
Abstract geometric blob	❌ No metaphor, fails recognizability
Icon with animated hover state	❌ Interaction logic embedded — forbidden
Off-center glyph	❌ Alignment failure
Blurry bitmap inside SVG	❌ Non-vector content

🧰 Enforced in the Logic Engine

The product logic engine should enforce these during all phases:
	1.	Image Recognition
	•	Reject images with color
	•	Flag non-icon content (photos, illustrations, cartoons)
	•	Detect off-grid geometry
	2.	Prompt Parsing / Generation
	•	Reject metaphors that can’t be iconified cleanly
	•	Auto-correct metaphors into valid icon primitives (e.g., “mail truck” → “mail” or “delivery”)
	3.	Post-Processing
	•	SVG validator runs: bounding box check, stroke-width consistency, fill mode check
	•	Pixel grid validator: confirms all geometry aligns to integer coordinates
	•	Style system validator: confirms compliance to Carbon, Material, or specified target system
