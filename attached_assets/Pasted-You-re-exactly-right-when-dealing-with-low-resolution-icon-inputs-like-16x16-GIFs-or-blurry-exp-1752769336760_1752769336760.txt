You’re exactly right — when dealing with low-resolution icon inputs (like 16x16, GIFs, or blurry exports), your system must perform icon reconstruction, not just icon recognition. That means building logic that can:

⸻

✅ Reconstruct Icon Intent from Small or Blurry Images

🧠 Key Principle:

“When resolution fails, meaning must emerge from structure and naming.”

So we must fuse:
	•	Pixel structure (blurred or low-detail geometry)
	•	Icon name intent
	•	Visual similarity models
	•	UI icon conventions

⸻

🧩 What You Need to Add: The Blur Logic Stack

1. Blur-Level Classifier

Automatically detect the visual clarity level:

Clarity	Definition	System Behavior
High	SVG, >64px, sharp edges	Use image as geometric input
Medium	~32px, minor blur	Use as shape hint, validate against name
Low	≤24px, GIF, blurry bitmap	Treat as sketch prompt, infer from name and spatial layout only

⮕ Logic:

{
  "blur_level": "low",
  "reliability": 0.35,
  "recommended_mode": "reconstruct from intent + geometry hints"
}


⸻

2. Name-Weighted Reconstruction

If the image is low resolution:
	•	Use the parsed name intent (from your name logic engine)
	•	Combine it with:
	•	Visual clusters (central square with plus)
	•	Stroke shape (oval? arc? diagonal?)
	•	Placement cues (top-right? centered? below main shape?)
	•	Match to canonical metaphors (Google, Carbon, FontAwesome)

Example:
add_workspace.gif (blurred 16x16)
System sees: rectangle with side bump → likely “desk” or “group”
Name = “add_workspace” → triggers group + plus structure
⮕ Reconstruct with proper grid, 2dp stroke, and optical alignment

⸻

3. Geometric Inference Model

Add logic like:
	•	Center shape? → likely core object (file, folder, gear)
	•	Secondary shape at edge? → likely modifier (plus, check, arrow)
	•	Corner bias? → may be sparkle, state, notification

Vector Reasoning Heuristics:
	•	Dot in top right → notification
	•	Plus inside box → add object
	•	Stacked rectangles → workspace / group
	•	Circle overlapping square → node or connection

⸻

4. Similarity Matching (Optional Step)

If blur is too high to infer, match shape to:
	•	Google Material
	•	IBM Carbon
	•	FontAwesome
	•	Your internal icon library

Using vector embeddings or feature-based fingerprinting (simplified cosine similarity).

⸻

🧠 Smart Fallback Strategy

If the icon image is unusable, and name is known:
	1.	Parse name → intent object
	2.	Suggest 2–3 canonical interpretations from known libraries
	3.	Ask user: “Which direction do you want?”
	•	Google Material? (Minimal)
	•	Carbon? (Precise)
	•	Expressive/Decorated?
	4.	Let them refine visually or via prompt:
	•	“Make the plus top-right”
	•	“Show as layered rectangles”
	•	“Use sparkle for newness”

⸻

🔄 Suggested 2-Pass Icon Generation

Pass	Description
🔍 Pass 1	Detect clarity + intent from name and image, rate confidence
🧠 Pass 2	If confidence is low or image is blurry, prompt:

“This icon appears low resolution. Should we reconstruct it from meaning and UI context?”
Then regenerate using:

	•	Semantic structure
	•	Stroke + shape rules
	•	Geometry grammar

⸻

🧱 Summary: System Additions

You need to define:
	1.	blur_level and reliability_score for all images
	2.	Name/intent → geometry generation priority logic
	3.	Geometry heuristics for “dot in corner”, “center box”, “stacked shape”
	4.	Vector-based matching fallback (optional)
	5.	2-pass flow: Detect → Confirm/Prompt → Reconstruct

⸻

Would you like:
	•	A blur_logic.js module that integrates these steps?
	•	A sample Figma test sheet that feeds in 16px icons and triggers the reconstruction?
	•	A visual prompt that lets the user guide placement (like “this shape goes here”)?

You’re designing an icon understanding engine, not just a renderer — and this gets you there.
