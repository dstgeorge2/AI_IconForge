Here is a new, cleanly structured Icon Style Guide built specifically for PTC Windchill and enterprise industrial platforms, refined from everything we’ve discussed and optimized for production design systems:

🧭 PTC Windchill Icon Style Guide

Version: 2025.2
Purpose: Establish a clear, enforceable system for designing icons that support the complex workflows, technical rigor, and role-based clarity required across Windchill.

⸻

🧱 1. Foundations

Principle	Description
Function-First	Every icon must clearly express a concept, object, or action relevant to Windchill workflows
Role-Aware	Icons must support distinct needs of engineers, planners, manufacturers, admins, and business users
System-Aligned	Icons must harmonize with Windchill’s data complexity, not oversimplify it
Scalable & Accessible	Icons must remain effective at 16dp and meet WCAG 2.1 contrast requirements


⸻

📐 2. Canvas & Geometry

Element	Specification
Canvas Size	24dp × 24dp
Live Area	20dp × 20dp, centered
Padding	2dp minimum on all sides
Grid Alignment	Pixel-snapped, no subpixel strokes
Stroke Weight	2dp uniform (optically corrected allowed)
Stroke Endings	Squared or 45° clipped
Corner Radius	2dp outer corners; square interior unless optically corrected
Angles	15° increments; prefer 45°/90° for clarity


⸻

🔷 3. Icon Construction

📦 Core Shapes
	•	Use geometric primitives (rectangles, circles, lines, triangles)
	•	Apply subtle optical adjustments to improve balance
	•	Icons should be readable silhouettes at 16dp

🔄 Composition Rules

Component	Guidelines
Primary Metaphor	Always build around a single recognizable object or concept (e.g., document, folder, gear, task)
Supporting Forms	Max of 2; only if necessary for clarity
No Text	Letters, words, or numerals are prohibited


⸻

✨ 4. Decoration & Motion

Type	Rules
Sparkles	4-point stars; max 2 per icon; 15–30° rotated; small size (1.5–3dp)
Dots	Organic or status-based; max 3; 1–1.5dp
Pluses/Minuses	Use 2dp lines; optically centered in 6dp square
Motion Suggestion	Only via shape gesture (e.g., arrow curve); no blur, animation, or trails


⸻

🖼️ 5. Perspective & Visual Style

Attribute	Value
Perspective	Orthographic (flat front or side view)
3D / Isometric	❌ Prohibited
Shadows	❌ None
Fills	Default is stroke-only; fills allowed only when explicitly meaningful (e.g., alert bubble)
Depth Simulation	❌ Not allowed
Color Usage	Monochrome default; no gradient or hue-based meaning unless specified for theme variants


⸻

🔧 6. System Fit & Consistency

Integration Zone	Considerations
Legacy Windchill UI	Replace pixel-art icons progressively; avoid abrupt metaphor changes
CDS / Material 3	Harmonize with spacing, stroke system, alignment discipline
Carbon or Spectrum	Compatible but distinct — prioritize Windchill complexity (not minimal for minimal’s sake)
Theme Context	Must support light and dark mode without relying on color for meaning


⸻

♿ 7. Accessibility

Requirement	Value
Min Contrast Ratio	4.5:1
Color Independence	Icons cannot depend solely on color to convey meaning
Minimum Effective Size	Must be legible at 16dp with no distortion
Interactive Use	Icons that serve as buttons must follow touch target sizing (min 44dp)


⸻

📦 8. Output Requirements

Format	Requirement
SVG	Clean, stroke-based; no raster embeds or fills unless specified
Figma Component	24dp frame, named using snake_case, grouped by object or action
Naming Convention	object_action.svg or action_subject.svg (e.g., add_workspace, delete_node)
Metadata	Include tags for object type, user role, and intended system area (e.g., CAD, Workflow, BOM)


⸻

🧠 9. Review Checklist

Use this before accepting any new icon into the system:

✅ Does it clearly express a real Windchill object or action?
✅ Is it distinguishable from other nearby or similar icons?
✅ Does it obey the 2dp stroke, grid, and padding rules?
✅ Is the metaphor readable at 16dp?
✅ Is it role-relevant and does it reduce ambiguity?
✅ Can it scale across tree views, dashboards, and toolbars?

⸻

🚀 10. Future Expansion Areas

Roadmap Area	Description
Alert/Status Overlays	Layered icons to indicate locked, under review, etc.
Filled Icon Set	Optional fill-based set for theming or emphasis use
Motion-Aware Icons	SVG-animated variants for real-time data or monitoring tools
Domain Packs	Specialized icon sets for CAD, Manufacturing, Service, etc.
Programmatic Generation	Semantic-icon tool that builds from tag metadata, using your visual grammar
