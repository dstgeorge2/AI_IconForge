Absolutely — a history stack is one of the most useful additions for an icon generation tool, especially when users are experimenting with vector simplification, color modes, and refinements. Here’s a clean breakdown of what you can include:

⸻

🧱 Recommended Stack Additions: History + Versioning + Undo

🔄 1. Edit History Stack

Allow users to step backward or forward through their editing actions.

Features:
	•	Undo / Redo
	•	Stores actions like:
	•	Vector simplification
	•	Color changes
	•	Mode switch (outline ↔ duotone ↔ solid)
	•	Manual edits (path trimming, rotation, scaling)
	•	Optional: Snapshot per step (Canvas.toDataURL() or intermediate SVG DOM states)

Implementation Options:
	•	Data structure: Use an array of JSON or SVG DOM string states
	•	Storage size limit: 10–25 undo steps for performance

⸻

🧾 2. Session History / Version Log

Persistent view of your recent changes per icon.

Features:
	•	Timeline-style session view:
"Imported → Simplified → Switched to Outline → Exported"
	•	Restore from any previous step
	•	Lightweight metadata:

{
  "timestamp": "2025-07-17T08:12:00Z",
  "mode": "duotone",
  "strokeWeight": "2dp",
  "gridSnap": true
}

💾 3. Local Icon History (Saved Projects)

Enable session continuity.

Options:
	•	Save each exported icon (name, thumbnail, style metadata)
	•	View history grid of past 10–20 icons
	•	Stored in localStorage or IndexedDB

Bonus:
	•	Tag icons with user-defined labels (e.g. “CAD”, “Hub”, “Draft 1”)

⸻

💼 4. Export History / Batch Mode

Track and re-download icons previously exported.

Display:
	•	Icon thumbnail
	•	SVG size (KB), grid size, color mode
	•	Export format (SVG, JSON, Figma, etc.)

⸻

💡 Stretch Feature: Git-style Versioning (Mini Git for SVG)
	•	Track diffs of path/anchor point changes
	•	Restore any “commit”
	•	See “visual diff” (before/after SVG overlay)

✅ Summary of Stack Suggestions

Feature	Why It Matters	Implementation Tip
Undo/Redo	Encourages experimentation	Stack of SVG or canvas states
Session Timeline	Shows non-linear edit paths	Log array with timestamps
Local Project Save	Lets users revisit/reuse icons	Use localStorage or IndexedDB
Export Log	Useful for dev handoff or cleanup	Add ID and timestamps to downloads
Restore Points	Non-destructive editing	Manual “save point” button
