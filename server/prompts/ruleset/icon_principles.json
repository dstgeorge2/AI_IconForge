  "principles": {
    "clarity": "Every icon must clearly represent a single function or concept. Avoid ambiguity or multiple meanings.",
    "recognizability": "Use common metaphors users will understand universally (house = home, gear = settings, envelope = mail).",
    "consistency": "All icons must match stroke weight, rhythm, scale, and visual treatment across the system.",
    "scalability": "Must remain readable and recognizable at 16dp minimum size. Test at small sizes.",
    "accessibility": "Must have contrast ratio â‰¥ 4.5:1 against background. No reliance on color alone for meaning.",
    "flatness": "Strict flat orthographic perspective. No shadows, gradients, 3D effects, or dimensional illusions.",
    "simplicity": "Avoid unnecessary detail. Think minimal but meaningful. Remove decorative elements that don't serve function.",
    "universality": "Icons must work across cultures and languages. Avoid region-specific symbols or metaphors.",
    "geometric_precision": "All coordinates must be integers. Snap to pixel grid. No subpixel positioning.",
    "metaphor_strength": "Choose the strongest, most immediate metaphor. Avoid weak or abstract representations."
